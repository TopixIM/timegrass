### Workflow

https://github.com/Cumulo/calcium-workflow

### Local development

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@4.12.0 --activate
caps
yarn install --immutable

# browser client and static assets
yarn watch-page
yarn dev-page

# realtime server
mode=dev calcit -w calcit.cirru --entry server
```

`calcit.cirru` now uses explicit entries: the default browser entry runs in
JavaScript mode and the `server` entry runs natively. `storage.cirru` remains
Cirru EDN and is loaded with `parse-cirru-edn` then written with
`format-cirru-edn`; its existing on-disk shape is preserved, with only runtime
sessions omitted as before.

The browser and server use nominal `ClientMessage` and `ServerMessage`
envelopes. Snapshots and patches carry monotonic revisions; the server advances
each client's diff baseline only after an ACK. Revision mismatch or invalid
patches are rejected atomically and request a fresh snapshot. Visibility and
heartbeat messages let inactive tabs stop receiving projections, while bounded
WebSocket backpressure retains only the newest dirty revision for retry.

The server coalesces updater-driven synchronization instead of scanning every
client on a fixed render interval. `read-sync-metrics` exposes patch/snapshot
attempts, UTF-8 payload bytes, diff latency, resync count, pending clients, and
slow clients. See [docs/realtime-sync.md](docs/realtime-sync.md) for the protocol,
failure behavior, and real slow-reader evidence.

Keep the Calcit CLI and `@calcit/procs` runtime on the same version. The local
development command starts Vite with `--force` so stale optimized dependencies
cannot retain a previous runtime after an upgrade.

### Upgrade validation

Use released module tags and validate the full graph before committing:

```bash
caps --strict --ci
calcit edit format
calcit --check-only
calcit --entry server --check-only
calcit analyze deprecated
yarn check-sync
yarn compile-page
yarn release-page
```

Never test a migration against the live `storage.cirru`. Copy it outside the
repository, then verify the same load/persist path used by the server. The
revision-protocol migration was checked against a copy of the real 736,198-byte
state; after a native server run and persistence, both the copy and source kept
SHA-256 `18212a22d8dfdcd9e9f3ecd8cbc7a5fd8975b7644432e4435ea0297a1935b191`.
